## Monday, June 17, 2024

Fully committed to taking a new route today. The way I see it, the worst case scenario is that I end up picking the phishing analysis back up. Hopefully I'll be able to find a more fulfilling alternative.

Took quite a bit of time to curate my paper list today -- brainstorming is hard work.

- Create list of papers that have interesting topics related to usable s&p
  - Start creating taxonomy of topics based on papers
- Come up with concrete reasons not to do CAPTCHA study
- Brainstorm other project ideas
  - Motivating questions creation
  - Think of topics related to my community
  - Start coming up with concrete questions related to passkey usability

## Summary

Not quite there yet!
