## Monday, June 17, 2024

For some reason, the University of Utah officially recognizes today as Juneteenth. So, I will be taking today off and working on Wednesday.

## Tuesday, June 18, 2024

Great day today! Got an early start, finalized my summer project idea (a bit late, I know), and got a solid start on data collection.

Progress:

- Met with Sameer
- Initialized guiding research documents
  - Agenda -- keeps track of what tasks there are to tackle
  - Progress -- keeps track of what there is to do, task completion, questions, concerns, and what there is to do next time on a session-by-session basis
- Created taxonomy of CAPTCHA types with the potential for ambiguous answers
- Installed the Tor Browser
- Collected a few sample CAPTCHAs

## Week 4 Summary

We'll see when it's over! :D
