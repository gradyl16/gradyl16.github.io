# Week 1 DREU Progress

Please note that the organization of this post and all subsequent ones will follow the same format. Each post will consist of a series of entries separated by date -- one for each that week -- followed by a summary of the main progress for the week as a whole.

## May 27, 2024

Today is Memorial Day; I officially start the program tomorrow.

## May 28, 2024

Today I began the program in earnest. My progress is as follows:

- Begin the CITI training course on conducting social/behavioral research on human subjects (roughly just over half done with 17 modules)

- Initialize this website

- Begin a more thorough brainstorm of project ideas beyond those previously discussed with my program mentor, Sameer Patil

- Plan tentative literature search based on brainstorm results

## May 29, 2024

Second day of the program -- had our first lab meeting!

We...

- Introduced our cohort to Sameer's lab
- Discussed potential project ideas for my DREU cohort members and myself
- Reviewed lab member progress for indvidual member projects

Afterwards, I spent the rest of the day working on my ethics training. I've successfully completed the course on *Ethical Social & Behavioral Research on Human Subjects* and began working on *Responsible Conduct of Research*.
