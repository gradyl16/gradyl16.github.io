## Week 9 Summary

This week was a lot of boilerplate stuff to get ready to submit my final report, resulting in an unfortunate lack of progress for the analysis itself. Alas, I need to make sure I meet program requirements.

I found a nice ACM LaTeX template that reminds me of CCS papers, and began drafting the first few sections (abstract, intro). I also began a secondary literature search in order to populate my related work section, situating my work within existing studies.

In terms of the actual analysis, I have the following residual notes from my progress log:

- Remodel authentication sequences in py script
    - Data class that tracks...
        - Start time
        - Previous time (i.e., that before the most recent time)
        - Attempts (list of log entries)
- Refactor handler function
    - Create local vars for conditions to improve readability
    - Incorporate new `AuthSequence` class
- Fix detection algorithm
    - Only analyzes failure sequences (i.e., those that are all failures or all failures but the last attempt)

Overall, I'm disappointed in the amount of useful findings I'll be able to extract. However, it has still been a fun experience, and I am welcome to continue working on it after the program end. Also, I still have one more week, so I'll give it my all!
