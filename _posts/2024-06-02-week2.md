# Week 2 DREU Progress

## Monday, June 3, 2024

Unfortunately, lost some time today as well in light of a faculty meeting with my home institution. I intend to make up Friday's and today's lost time over the course of this week, and potentially the weekend.

My progress today is as follows:

- Organize my thoughts on the digital fingerprinting paper
- Email Prof. Patil my thoughts on the digital fingerprinting paper
- Begin reading and taking notes on the next paper in the list that was referred to me
  - Interview-based study on "made-up" email addresses

## Tuesday, June 4, 2024

My contributions for today:

- Finish reading and taking notes on the made-up email paper
- Read and notate the cybersecurity learning capstone paper
- Read and notate the paper on regional differences among CAPTCHAs
- Prepare some minimal slides to present my thoughts on the papers I've read during tomorrow's lab meeting
