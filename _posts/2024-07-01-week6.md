## Monday, July 1, 2024

Nice, chill day today. Finished reading all of the prerequisite content and made a decent start on brainstorming specific avenues for log analysis. Waiting on Sameer for log access, so can't start any practical efforts until then.

Progress:

- Finished IUB paper + notes
- Emailed Sameer with thoughts on 2FA usability papers
- Investigated tooling for data analysis
- Brainstormed questions to answer

## Week 7 Summary
