Due to an emergency family matter, I was not able to accomplish much today.

Progress:

- Wrote code to read in all partial log files to a single data frame
    [!NOTE]
    Since there are ~96 million logs (~19GB), this strategy is infeasible for low/mid memory systems.

I have a lot of ideas for what I can do, but I also keep thinking up obstacles. One major limitation is the lack of memory on my desktop (~16 GiB). I could use my beefier laptop to actually run the code, but it makes testing tedious to rely on that. On the other hand, it is annoying to try to optimize for memory usage while still making sure I can capture all of the necessary data in my analysis. It would be ideal to just load all of the data into a single data frame, manipulate it, and call it a day.

Progress:

- Reviewed previous paper to see what already has been done in terms of statistical analysis and visualization
- 10 minutes to pandas tutorial completion
- Read `df.read_csv()` docs to figure out way to do "sliding window" strategy for reading across multiple logs (`chunksize=x` + `TextReader`)
    [!IMPORTANT]
    Don't worry about this until you can meaningfully process a single file
- Select data for a single user and load into data frame

Not there yet :D
