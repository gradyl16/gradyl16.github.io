# DREU '24 Project Idea Brainstorm

## Data

- Readily available user-reported phishing emails from U Utah
    - Take into account bias of sample (i.e., these are *user-reported*)
    - What can be done with these phishing emails? (backwards way to think about it?)
        - Studying emails qualitatively may say something interesting about the kind of phishing campaigns/attempts that are noticeable to ordinary users
    - Potentially augment with collected data on attitudes towards phishing + experiments observing people who are under the impression they are being actively phished?
        - Need to flesh out idea before jumping on data to test hypotheses

## Ideas

- CAPTCHA usability
    - Suggested by Sameer
- Social engineering studies
    - Something based on phishing
        - Generalized phishing
        - Spearphishing
        - *Note:* keep ethics in mind, tricky to study
    - Insider threats in organizational security
        - Difficult to study :(
- Authentication mechanism usability
    - Password usability (probably overdone)
    - Passkey usability
        - Do security keys enhance or weaken security given that users must protect physical access to their devices?
    - SSO/OAuth usability
    - MFA usability
- User attitudes towards importance of (web) privacy
    - Overdone?
    - Social media privacy
        - Importance of being anonymous online?
    - Cookie usage / consent
    - Opinions on tracking / surveillance
        - Awareness of fingerprinting (specifically browser fingerprinting)
        - Feelings about targeted advertising
- Something with fingerprint / face as authentication mechanism
- Perceived security / privacy across environments and devices
    - Confidence in email security
    - E.g. do you feel more secure browsing a desktop on a home network than a phone on a cellular network? etc
- Something on open source intelligence
