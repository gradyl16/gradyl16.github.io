## About Me

Hi, all! My name is Dylen Greenenwald. I've recently obtained my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Chicago -- this will be my last undergraduate experience! I will be starting my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign during the fall 2024 semester, broadly studying security and privacy.

Feel free to reach out and contact me at dgree21 [at] illinois (dot) edu. I am currently working on launching my first attempt at a [personal website](https://greenenwald.com), so while it's not accessible in a functioning capacity yet, you should be able to find out more about me there in the near future :)
